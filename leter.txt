Recently we received your application for the Statistical Programmer Position. If this is still of interest for you - next step of the interview is the following problem as home task: please create a table with descriptive statistics for “Iris Flowers” dataset.

After solution review for the task described below, we’ll have a short call and schedule interview date.



Data: iris_data.csv

Data description: info_names.txt

Both can be found in the attachment.

Some general words about dataset can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set



Requirements for the solution:

You can use any programming language of your choice for this task.
Created table should be consistent with the template below (reasonable deviations from layout are acceptable). Numbers in the table should be replaced with actual numbers based on data.
Alignment of numbers is up to you but table should be readable and easy to understand.
Precision should be:
N – integer
Min, max – same precision as in dataset (1 decimal point)
Median, mean, standard deviation - +1 digit to data precision
Percents should be rounded up to 1 digit after decimal point.
It is expected that you’ll send back:

program named “solution” (with extension depending on prog language).
table named “iris-flowers.txt” containing analysis described above (generated by program).
Estimated time for completions: <= 20Nov2021 (ok to send earlier if it is ready)



The following template can be used (once again reasonable deviations from the template are acceptable)
